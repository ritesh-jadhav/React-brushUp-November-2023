npm -> Something that manage the dependancies


parcel -> buddler that will wrap up all the things and take that packed pakages towards the production 

# Parcel - A Beast 
    - Dev build
    - local development server 
    - HMR = Hot module replacement
    - uses File waching algorithm written for latest build in c++ 
    - Caching - Faster build (Reduces build time)
    - Tree Shaking - remove unused code
    - Image optimization 
    - compress file and optimize Bundle by removing whitespaces of all js code  
    - Code splitting
    - Consistent hashing 
    - Differential bundle (support for older browsers)
    - Beautify errors and gives diagostic of the app 


dist folder -> parcel will pack all the code inside a package and takes care it should be delivered to the development server
.parce-cache -> cache will used to reduce the build time (time gets reduce as the number of times builds)



npm install -D parcel -> -D will add the dependancies in development environment only (npm install dependancy_name will install and use the common dependancies in both development and production environment )
npx -> command to unpack any installed package
npx  parcel index.html -> packe the code and deploy the file on the development server(hosting an application on server)

npx parcel build index.html -> will create a productions ready build (only core files of the application)
